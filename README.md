# 📡 *IoT Integration Flow Documentation*

## 📄 *Overview*
This application is currently running with mock data and real-time updates to simulate the full integration process. The actual IoT integration will follow the structured workflow detailed below.

---

## 🛠 *Integration Plan*

### *1️⃣ Data Collection from IoT Devices and Smart Meters*
   - IoT devices and smart meters *continuously monitor* and *collect data*.
   - This data is formatted and saved into a *JSON file*.

---

### *2️⃣ Storing Data on IPFS*
   - The JSON file is uploaded to the *InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)*.
   - A unique *Content Identifier (CID)* or *hash* is generated after successful storage.

---

### *3️⃣ Storing the Hash on Blockchain*
   - The generated *CID* is stored on the *blockchain*.
   - We utilize *Alchemy* to handle blockchain transactions and storage operations.

---

### *4️⃣ Data Retrieval Process*
   To retrieve and access the data:
   1. *Fetch the CID*: Retrieve the hash stored on the blockchain.
   2. *Retrieve Data: Use the CID to fetch the actual JSON data file from **IPFS*.
